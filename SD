What My Parents Think of Me

My parents consider me an important member of the family, involving me in significant decisions like choosing the paint color for the walls or selecting the best brand for purchases.
They also recognize my efforts to maintain our cultural traditions, especially when interacting with relatives and following the village lifestyle.

My mother particularly appreciates that I take on responsibilities, such as submitting my brother's fees, teaching him, and helping with household chores.
They are proud of my self-motivation, especially when it comes to maintaining good grades in school and college. However, 
they sometimes remind me to prioritize my health, as I tend to forget to eat while immersed in my work.


Teachers and Classmates

My teachers and classmates see me as a disciplined and up-to-date student, which has led to them entrusting me with various responsibilities, 
such as anchoring at the farewell, being a group captain, and serving as vice-captain of the house in school.
They view me as a good team player, often including me in sports teams, event planning, and organizing committees, appreciating the positivity I bring to the group.
They believe I should focus on one task at a time to excel more quickly and make them proud.


What My Friends Think of Me

My friends consider me the "Chaudary" of our group because I'm the one who plans our treks, locations, and venues. They know I enjoy these adventures, 
as we go on a big trek together twice a year, where we share our day-to-day problems and support each other in any way we can.
They also think I’m curious, as we often visit random places and cafés together without any set plan. Sometimes, they suggest I should work on my habit 
of saying yes to everything. Thanks to my friends, I've also improved my dressing sense.


What I Think About Myself

I see myself as a compassionate and hardworking person who understands his goals and prioritizes them effectively.
Being in software, I appreciate the randomness of the field and am always ready to handle failures or adapt according to the task and team.
I believe that regularly checking in on friends and team members helps build strong relationships.

I have a deep love for the mountains and take pride in following and preserving my culture, including my language, Garhwali. 
I enjoy going on treks, rafting, visiting the village, and spending time with my grandparents. 
I also find fulfillment in contributing to others' success, whether it's helping friends prepare for interviews or supporting them when they express their pain.



Improvements I See in Myself

I’m becoming a better listener, especially when meeting new people. I’m working on this by observing my behavior in social situations and listening to podcasts.

I’ve also recognized my tendency to procrastinate and leave things until the last minute. I’m actively trying to overcome this 
by tackling tasks as they come, instead of putting them off.


The Kind of Person I Want to Become

I envision myself becoming an officer in the Armed Forces, fulfilling my desire and making my alma mater proud. 
I look up to my father and Virat Kohli as role models, inspired by their hard work and determination during their younger years.
I aspire to motivate my juniors to take on difficult challenges and see them through to completion.
